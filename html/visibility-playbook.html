<h2>Pure Distribution &amp; Discovery | Feb 2026</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The only question this doc answers: <strong>How do we get PrimeState in front of as many people as possible, as fast as possible?</strong> Not retention. Not product changes. Visibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>THE CONSTRAINT SET</h2>
<ul>
<li>No founder face. Brand-only.</li>
<li>Near-zero budget.</li>
<li>Product Hunt launch Feb 6.</li>
<li>App exists and works. V2 in review.</li>
<li>Team: J (product) + Axel (marketing automation).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>PART 1: IMMEDIATE (Next 7 Days — PH Launch Week)</h2>
<h3>1. Product Hunt Launch Maximization (Feb 6)</h3>
<p>PH is your single biggest visibility event. One shot. Here's how to extract maximum eyeballs:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-launch (Feb 4-5):</strong>
- DM 20-30 PH power users and ask them to follow the launch page (they get notified at launch)
- Post in PH-related communities: Indie Hackers, relevant Slack/Discord groups, Twitter
- Schedule tweets/posts for 12:01 AM PT launch: "We just launched on Product Hunt"
- Prep your maker comment — the first thing people read. Lead with the problem, not the product: "Your $80/month supplement stack — is it actually doing anything? We built PrimeState to answer that question with YOUR data."
- Have 10+ friends/supporters ready to upvote + leave genuine comments in the first 2 hours (PH algorithm weights early momentum heavily)</p>
<p><strong>Launch day (Feb 6):</strong>
- Post at 12:01 AM PT sharp
- Respond to EVERY comment within 15 minutes (PH rewards engagement)
- Cross-post to: Twitter, Reddit (where appropriate), Discord communities, Telegram groups, LinkedIn
- Send email to your list (even if small)
- Post in Indie Hackers "Launch" section
- Share in QS forums, biohacker Discord/Telegram groups</p>
<p><strong>Post-launch (Feb 7-8):</strong>
- Thank everyone who commented
- Share results publicly ("We hit #X on Product Hunt — here's what we learned")
- The PH page continues to drive traffic for weeks if you finish top 10</p>
<p><strong>Target: Top 5 of the day. 200+ upvotes. 500+ unique visitors.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Show HN (Same Week or Week After)</h3>
<p>Hacker News is the single highest-quality audience for a dev-focused cognitive app. A good Show HN can drive 10K+ visitors in a day.</p>
<p><strong>The post:</strong>
- Title: "Show HN: PrimeState – Track what foods and supplements actually affect your cognition"
- Lead with the technical angle: the correlation engine, the delayed-effect detection (48-72 hours), the statistical approach
- Be genuine: "I built this because I noticed dark chocolate improved my focus but had no way to prove it"
- HN loves: technical depth, genuine problem-solving, open discussion of methodology
- HN hates: marketing speak, growth hacking language, "we're disrupting X"</p>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Don't stack with PH launch. Do it 3-5 days after so you get two separate visibility spikes.</p>
<p><strong>Target: Front page for 2+ hours. 50+ points. 5K+ visitors.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Reddit Seeding (Ongoing, Starting Now)</h3>
<p>Not "post about PrimeState." Post CONTENT that drives curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>High-value subreddits:</strong>
| Subreddit | Members | Angle |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| r/Nootropics | 1.2M | "What's the best way to objectively measure if your stack is working?" |
| r/Biohackers | 500K+ | "Has anyone tracked food→cognition correlations long-term? Here's what I found..." |
| r/Supplements | 400K+ | "I've been tracking which of my supplements actually affect my cognitive scores — surprising results" |
| r/productivity | 2.5M+ | "The food-focus connection nobody talks about" |
| r/decaf | 109K | "I tracked my cognitive performance while quitting caffeine — data inside" |
| r/getdisciplined | 1M+ | "I ran a 7-day experiment on how sugar affects my focus. Results surprised me." |
| r/Quantified Self | 50K+ | Technical deep-dive on the correlation methodology |</p>
<p><strong>The play:</strong> Post genuinely interesting personal findings. Include data/screenshots. When people ask "how did you track this?" — that's when you mention PrimeState. Let the curiosity come to you.</p>
<p><strong>Content format that crushes on Reddit:</strong>
- "I did [experiment] for [time]. Here are the results." + data visualization
- Before/after narratives with numbers
- "Things I learned tracking X for 30 days"
- Controversial findings ("Turns out my $200/month supplement stack was doing nothing")</p>
<p><strong>Key rule:</strong> The post has to be interesting WITHOUT PrimeState. If you removed the app mention entirely, would people still upvote it? If yes, it's a good post. If no, it's an ad disguised as content.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Twitter/X Thread Blitz</h3>
<p>Threads get 3-10x the reach of single tweets. Schedule 3-5 threads in launch week:</p>
<p><strong>Thread ideas:</strong>
1. "I tracked what I ate vs how well I could think for 60 days. Here's what I learned 🧵" — personal story with data points, surprising findings, PrimeState mention at the end
2. "The supplement industry is a $60B experiment with no control group. Here's how to fix that for yourself. 🧵" — problem-awareness thread
3. "Your body is a system with inputs and outputs. Most people optimize inputs blindly. Here's the developer's approach to cognitive performance. 🧵" — dev-native framing
4. "I found out that corn affects my cognitive performance for 72 hours. Nobody told me this — I found it in my own data. 🧵" — surprising personal finding
5. "We just launched PrimeState on Product Hunt. Here's the story of why I built it. 🧵" — launch story (post from @Inner_Axiom or brand account)</p>
<p><strong>Post threads at 8-10 AM PT (peak engagement) or 5-7 PM PT (commute scroll).</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>PART 2: HIGH-LEVERAGE VISIBILITY (Days 7-30)</h2>
<h3>5. Newsletter Sponsorships / Mentions (Cheap, Targeted)</h3>
<p>Small newsletters in niche communities are the most underpriced visibility channel in 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Target newsletters:</strong>
| Newsletter | Audience | Subscribers (est.) | Approach |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Quantified Bob / QS newsletters | Self-trackers | 5-20K | Free product for review |
| Superhuman (by Zack Kanter) | Productivity nerds | 100K+ | Paid mention ($200-500) |
| Ben's Bites | AI/tech builders | 100K+ | PH launch share |
| Dense Discovery | Design/tech | 40K+ | App recommendation |
| Recomendo (Kevin Kelly) | Curious generalists | 30K+ | Tool recommendation |
| The Pragmatic Engineer (Gergely Orosz) | Developers | 500K+ | Long shot — but we already engaged on Bluesky |
| Various biohacking newsletters | Biohackers | 1-10K each | Product seeding |</p>
<p><strong>The play:</strong> Don't ask for "sponsorship." Ask for a mention or review. Send a genuine email: "We built PrimeState — it finds correlations between what you eat and how you think. Thought your readers might find it interesting. Happy to give you/them free access." Newsletter authors are always looking for interesting things to recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: $0-500 total. Expected reach: 10K-50K targeted eyeballs.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>6. The Free Tool as Visibility Engine</h3>
<p>Build ONE free web tool that provides standalone value and drives awareness.</p>
<p><strong>"What Should You Test First?" quiz</strong> at primestate.dev/quiz
- 5 questions about diet, supplements, habits
- Output: personalized recommendation of what to experiment with + the science behind it
- Shareable result card ("I should test my coffee habit first — what about you?")
- CTA: "Run this experiment with PrimeState"
- Email capture on full results</p>
<p><strong>Why this drives visibility (not just leads):</strong>
- Can be posted in ANY community as a free resource without being self-promotion
- Each quiz result is a shareable card = organic distribution
- Quiz content ranks on Google for long-tail searches
- Can be shared by newsletter authors as a "cool tool"</p>
<p><strong>Build time: 1-2 days. It's a single-page web app.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>7. App Store Featuring</h3>
<p>Apple features apps in editorial collections ("Apps We Love," "New Apps We Love," category spotlights). Getting featured is the highest-ROI visibility event possible — millions of App Store browsers see you.</p>
<p><strong>How to increase chances:</strong>
- Use latest Apple APIs (HealthKit integration, Live Activities, Dynamic Island, StoreKit 2)
- Beautiful, polished screenshots that show off iOS design principles
- Submit to Apple's editorial team: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/">developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/</a>
- Pitch angle: "PrimeState uses AI to find personalized food→cognition correlations — a use case that showcases what personal health data can do on iOS"
- Time the pitch around Health &amp; Fitness category promotions or "New Year, New You" type campaigns</p>
<p><strong>This is free. Zero downside. Even a small feature (category spotlight) can drive thousands of downloads.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Infographic / Data Visualization Content</h3>
<p>Beautiful, shareable visuals spread faster than text. Create 5-10 infographics about cognitive science topics:</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong>
- "The Hidden Timeline: How Food Affects Your Brain (0-72 hours)" — visual timeline showing immediate vs delayed effects
- "The $60B Experiment: What We Know (and Don't) About Popular Supplements" — evidence pyramid for top 10 supplements
- "Your Brain on Coffee: The Real Data" — hour-by-hour cognitive effects of caffeine
- "Foods That Tank Your Focus (And When You'll Feel It)" — visual showing delayed effects people don't expect
- "The Biohacker's Periodic Table" — visual of supplements organized by evidence quality</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong>
- Pinterest (infographics are Pinterest's native format — long shelf life, organic discovery)
- Instagram (carousel format — 5-10 slides per topic)
- Twitter/X (single image with thread for context)
- Reddit (r/coolguides, r/dataisbeautiful, r/Nootropics)
- Each infographic watermarked with "primestate.dev" — subtle but present</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Infographics get saved, shared, and reposted. They have a long tail. A good infographic on Pinterest can drive traffic for years. And the "PrimeState" watermark travels with it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. "Build in Public" Data Series</h3>
<p>Instead of marketing the app, market the FINDINGS. Use J's own data (or your own tracking) to create a public content series.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Weekly post — "Week X of tracking my brain"
- What I ate / took this week
- Cognitive scores
- Surprising patterns
- What I'm testing next week</p>
<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Twitter thread + blog post (for SEO) + Reddit cross-post</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> It's not marketing. It's a genuine public experiment. People follow experiments because they want to see how they end. And every post naturally demonstrates what PrimeState does — without ever being an ad.</p>
<p><strong>The hook:</strong> "I'm tracking everything I eat and measuring how it affects my thinking. Follow along." That's a compelling narrative that people share.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Quora Domination</h3>
<p>Quora answers rank on Google and drive traffic for YEARS. It's the most underutilized long-tail SEO channel.</p>
<p><strong>Target questions:</strong>
- "Does [supplement] actually improve focus?"
- "How can I track if my nootropics are working?"
- "What causes brain fog after eating?"
- "Is there an app that tracks cognitive performance?"
- "How do I know if my supplement stack is effective?"
- "What foods improve mental clarity?"</p>
<p><strong>For each:</strong> Write a genuinely excellent, detailed answer. Include your own data/experience. Mention PrimeState naturally where relevant ("I use PrimeState to track this — here's what my data shows").</p>
<p><strong>Volume:</strong> Answer 2-3 questions per day. In 30 days, you have 60-90 high-quality answers ranking on Google.</p>
<hr />
<h3>11. Short-Form Video (TikTok / Reels / Shorts)</h3>
<p>The single highest-reach organic channel in 2026. One viral video can get more eyeballs than everything else combined.</p>
<p><strong>Content format (faceless, brand-only):</strong>
- Screen recordings of PrimeState showing surprising correlations + text overlays + trending audio
- "POV: PrimeState just told you popcorn tanks your focus for 3 days"
- "Things your supplement company doesn't want you to know" + data reveals
- "I tested [supplement] for 30 days — here's what happened" (text + data on screen, no face needed)
- "Brain fog foods tier list" (based on data)
- Dark, cinematic style (Ben Lionel Scott aesthetic for longer-form; punchy data reveals for short-form)</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Post same content across TikTok (@theinnersignal), YouTube Shorts (@InnerSignal777), Instagram Reels</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Short-form video doesn't need a face. Data reveals, screen recordings, text-on-screen, and trending audio can all go viral without showing a person. The @theinnersignal account is already set up for this.</p>
<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 1 video/day for 30 days. Most will get 100-500 views. One might hit 100K+. That's the game — volume + consistency + one breakout.</p>
<hr />
<h3>12. Strategic App Review Submissions</h3>
<p>Submit PrimeState to every app review site, directory, and "best of" list. This is grunt work but it compounds.</p>
<p><strong>Targets:</strong>
- AppAdvice / AppShopper
- AlternativeTo (list as alternative to: MyFitnessPal, Noom, Oura, etc.)
- Product Hunt (already planned)
- BetaList (for beta/new apps)
- Launching.io
- SaaSHub (if applicable)
- AppSumo (for deals)
- Relevant "best biohacking apps" and "best supplement tracking apps" listicles — email the authors and ask to be included
- Health/tech bloggers who review apps</p>
<p><strong>For listicle inclusion:</strong> Search Google for "best supplement tracking apps 2025/2026" and "best biohacking apps." Email every author: "Hey, we just launched PrimeState — it tracks food/supplement→cognition correlations. Might be worth including in your list. Happy to give you a free account."</p>
<hr />
<h3>13. Cross-Promotion with Complementary Apps/Brands</h3>
<p>Partner with products that share your audience but don't compete.</p>
<p><strong>Potential partners:</strong>
| Partner | Overlap | Cross-promo idea |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Sleep Cycle / Pillow | Sleep trackers → focus next day | "See how your sleep affects cognition" |
| Headspace / Waking Up | Meditation → cognitive performance | "Track if meditation actually improves your focus" |
| Examine.com | Supplement research | Co-content: "Do supplements work? The personal data says..." |
| Streaks / Habitica | Habit tracking | "Track the cognitive impact of your habits" |
| Athletic Greens / AG1 | Supplement users | "Track if AG1 is actually working for you" |
| Nootropics Depot | Supplement sellers | "Test your stack" partnership |</p>
<p><strong>The ask:</strong> Not money. Just mutual visibility. "We'll mention you, you mention us." Or: "Let us write a guest post for your blog about [relevant topic]."</p>
<hr />
<h3>14. Controversy Content</h3>
<p>Provocative content gets 10x the visibility of safe content. Not because you're being inflammatory — because you're challenging assumptions with data.</p>
<p><strong>Content pieces to publish:</strong>
- "I spent $200/month on nootropics. Here's what was actually working." (blog + Reddit + Twitter thread)
- "The top 5 supplements people think help focus — and what the personal data actually shows" (infographic + thread)
- "Why your productivity advice is backwards: it's not about habits, it's about what you ate yesterday"
- "I tracked 100 meals and their effect on my thinking. 3 findings nobody talks about."</p>
<p><strong>Distribution strategy for controversy:</strong>
- Post the finding as a standalone claim (Twitter/Reddit)
- Let people argue about it
- Drop the methodology/data in the thread when asked
- Mention PrimeState as the tool used, not the focus of the post
- The debate IS the distribution</p>
<hr />
<h3>15. Piggyback on Every Relevant Trend</h3>
<p>When cognitive performance, supplements, brain fog, or biohacking trends on any platform — have content ready to deploy.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-built content templates:</strong>
- "Speaking of [trending topic] — here's what personal data shows about how it affects cognition" (generic enough to adapt)
- Data visualizations ready to customize
- Quick-response tweets/posts for trending health discussions</p>
<p><strong>Monitor:</strong>
- Twitter trending topics related to health/supplements
- Reddit front page posts about brain fog, productivity, supplements
- TikTok trending sounds that can be paired with cognitive data reveals
- News stories about supplement research</p>
<p><strong>When a relevant trend hits:</strong> Deploy within 2 hours. Speed &gt; perfection.</p>
<hr />
<h2>PART 3: COMPOUNDING VISIBILITY (Month 2+)</h2>
<h3>16. SEO Content Machine</h3>
<p>Write blog posts targeting high-intent long-tail searches. These compound over time.</p>
<p><strong>Target keywords:</strong>
- "does [supplement name] improve focus" (one post per major supplement)
- "how to track cognitive performance"
- "brain fog after eating [food]"
- "best nootropics tracking app"
- "does caffeine actually help focus"
- "food and brain fog connection"
- "how to know if supplements work"</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> 1,500-2,500 word posts. Genuinely helpful. Include your own data where possible. Link to PrimeState naturally. Optimize for featured snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 2-3 posts per week. In 3 months, you have 25-35 posts ranking for long-tail keywords. This becomes a passive traffic machine.</p>
<hr />
<h3>17. The "Cognitive Performance Report"</h3>
<p>Once you have enough user data (Month 3+), publish a quarterly "State of Cognitive Performance" report.</p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong>
- Aggregate, anonymized findings from PrimeState users
- "The 10 foods most correlated with high cognitive scores"
- "Average cognitive scores by day of week"
- Seasonal patterns, trending supplements, surprising findings</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong>
- Press release to health/tech media
- Blog post with downloadable PDF
- Infographic summary for social
- Pitch to newsletters and podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Why this drives visibility:</strong> Data reports get cited. They get linked to. They get covered by press. One good report can generate 50+ backlinks and media mentions.</p>
