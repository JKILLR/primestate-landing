<h2>PRODUCT HUNT LAUNCH — Feb 6, 12:01 AM PT</h2>
<h3>The Listing</h3>
<p><strong>Product Name:</strong> PrimeState</p>
<p><strong>Tagline:</strong> "Your supplements are an experiment. Start measuring the results."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Your body is running experiments every day — every meal, every supplement, every cup of coffee changes how your brain performs. The problem? You're flying blind.</p>
<p>PrimeState tracks the connection between what you consume and how you think. Not with generic advice from a database — with YOUR data, from YOUR body.</p>
<p>Log what you eat. Rate your cognition. PrimeState's AI engine finds the patterns you'd never catch yourself — including delayed effects that show up 48-72 hours later.</p>
<p>That "brain fog Wednesday" might be caused by what you ate Monday. PrimeState finds those connections.</p>
<p><strong>Key features to highlight:</strong>
- AI-powered correlation engine that finds food→cognition patterns
- Detects delayed effects (48-72 hours) that no other app tracks
- Personalized insights — not population averages, YOUR data
- Beautiful cognitive performance tracking
- Supplement stack effectiveness measurement</p>
<p><strong>Topics/Categories:</strong> Health &amp; Fitness, Artificial Intelligence, Productivity, Quantified Self</p>

<h3>The Maker Comment (Posted Immediately After Launch)</h3>
<p>This is the most important piece of copy in the entire launch. It's the first thing everyone reads.</p>
<pre><code>Hey PH! 👋

Quick question — do you actually know if your supplement stack is doing anything?

Not &quot;a study says it works.&quot; Not &quot;I feel like it helps.&quot; Do you have data — YOUR data — showing it makes a measurable difference to how you think?

I didn't. I was spending $200/month on nootropics and had zero evidence any of it was working. So I built PrimeState.

Here's what makes it different from every other health tracker:

🧠 **It finds what you'd never catch yourself.** PrimeState's AI engine doesn't just track — it discovers. Correlations between what you eat and how you perform that you'd never notice on your own. I found out that corn tanks my cognitive performance for up to 3 days. Nobody told me that. My own data did.

⏰ **It sees delayed effects.** Most people think food effects are immediate. They're not. That brain fog on Wednesday? It might be what you ate Monday. PrimeState tracks 48-72 hour delayed correlations that no other app even looks for.

🔬 **It's YOUR data, not a database.** No generic &quot;superfoods&quot; lists. No one-size-fits-all advice. PrimeState learns YOUR body's unique responses. Because your biology doesn't care what works for the average person.

We're early. V2 just shipped with a completely rebuilt AI engine. I'd love for the PH community to tear it apart — what works, what doesn't, what you'd want to see next.

If you've ever wondered whether your morning coffee, your supplement stack, or that &quot;healthy&quot; smoothie is actually helping your brain — PrimeState will tell you.

Try it free. Your brain has patterns. PrimeState finds them.
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Pre-Written Responses to Common PH Comments</h3>
<p><strong>"How is this different from MyFitnessPal / Cronometer?"</strong></p>
<pre><code>Great question. Those apps track nutrition — calories, macros, micros. PrimeState tracks something completely different: cognitive performance.

We don't care about your calorie count. We care about whether what you ate made you think better or worse. And specifically, we look for delayed effects — the food you ate Monday affecting your focus on Wednesday. That's the gap no nutrition app touches.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>"How do you measure cognitive performance?"</strong></p>
<pre><code>You rate your own cognitive state — focus, energy, clarity — throughout the day. Simple and fast. 

&quot;But that's subjective!&quot; — yes, and that's actually the point. We're measuring YOUR perception of YOUR cognition, correlated with YOUR inputs. Over enough data points, the noise averages out and real patterns emerge. Same principle behind every n-of-1 study in clinical research.

We're exploring adding objective micro-tests in future versions, but the self-report model works surprisingly well when you have enough data.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>"Is there any scientific basis for this?"</strong></p>
<pre><code>N-of-1 trials are an established methodology in clinical research. The idea that individual responses to food/supplements vary dramatically from population averages is well-documented — it's why personalized nutrition is one of the fastest-growing areas in health science.

What PrimeState does differently is make this accessible. You don't need a research lab. You don't need a nutritionist. You track, the AI finds patterns, you learn what works for YOUR body.

The 48-72 hour delayed correlation detection is based on the established science of delayed food sensitivities and gut-brain axis research. Most people don't realize how long food effects can take to manifest cognitively.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>"Looks interesting! What's the pricing?"</strong></p>
<pre><code>Free to use with core tracking and basic insights. Premium unlocks the full AI correlation engine, advanced patterns, and detailed reports. We wanted to make sure everyone can start discovering their patterns before deciding if they want deeper analysis.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>"I love this idea! Been looking for something like this."</strong></p>
<pre><code>That means a lot — this started because I couldn't find it either. Would love to hear what you discover once you start tracking. The first surprising correlation is always the best moment. 🧠
</code></pre>
<p><strong>"How much data do you need before it finds something useful?"</strong></p>
<pre><code>Most users start seeing initial patterns within 5-7 days. The AI gets meaningfully better at 2-3 weeks as it has more data points to separate signal from noise.

The delayed correlation detection (48-72 hour effects) needs a bit more data to be confident — usually 2-3 weeks. But that's also where the most surprising discoveries happen. The stuff you never would have connected on your own.

<p><strong>Template (personalize the [bracketed] parts):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hey [name] — I noticed you [upvoted/commented on/hunted] [relevant product]. 

We're launching PrimeState on PH Thursday (Feb 6). It's a cognitive tracking app that uses AI to find correlations between what you eat/supplement and how your brain actually performs — including delayed effects that show up 48-72 hours later.

The insight that sparked it: I discovered that corn tanks my cognitive performance for 3 days. That's not in any database — my own data surfaced it. PrimeState makes that kind of personal discovery accessible to anyone.

Would love your thoughts on launch day if it catches your eye. No pressure — just thought it'd resonate given your interest in [health/productivity/quantified self].

Here's the upcoming page: [link]

Cheers

<h3>DM Template — Indie Hackers / Builders</h3>
<pre><code>Hey [name] — saw your work on [their project]. Really cool.

Quick heads up: launching PrimeState on Product Hunt Thursday. It's a cognitive performance tracker that finds what foods/supplements actually affect YOUR thinking — using AI correlation analysis, not generic databases.

The &quot;aha&quot; moment that inspired it: finding out specific foods were tanking my focus for days without me realizing it. The delayed effect detection (48-72 hours) is something no other health app does.

Would mean a lot if you checked it out on launch day. Happy to return the favor when you launch something.

<h2>SOCIAL MEDIA WAVE — Launch Day (Feb 6)</h2>
<p>Everything fires in sequence. Coordinated, not chaotic.</p>
<h3>Twitter/X — @Inner_Axiom</h3>

<p><strong>Tweet 2 (8:00 AM PT — morning crowd):</strong></p>
<pre><code>I was spending $200/month on nootropics with zero evidence any of it was working.

So I built an app that actually tells you.

<p><strong>Thread (10:00 AM PT — peak engagement):</strong></p>
<pre><code>🧵 I tracked everything I ate for 60 days and measured how it affected my thinking.

Here's what I found — and what it taught me about the $60B supplement industry.

[1/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Most people take supplements on faith.

&quot;Studies show it works&quot; — but studies show population averages. Your body isn't a population average.

I wanted MY data. So I built PrimeState to find MY patterns.

[2/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The first surprise: dark chocolate consistently improved my focus scores.

I had no idea flavanols affect cognition. I didn't need to know — the data showed me before I ever googled it.

That's the power of tracking YOUR responses instead of reading studies about OTHER people.

[3/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The bigger surprise: corn products tanked my cognitive performance for up to 72 HOURS.

Not immediately. Not the next day. Three days later.

If I'd only tracked same-day effects — like every other health app does — I never would have caught it.

[4/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>This is the problem with generic health advice:

Your body is running a unique experiment every day. Every meal, every supplement, every habit produces a response that's YOURS.

No database can tell you how YOUR brain responds to YOUR diet.

Only your own data can.

[5/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The supplement industry is a $60 billion blind experiment.

Millions of people spending hundreds per month on stacks they've never measured.

Not because they're stupid — because until now, there was no easy way to measure it.

That's what PrimeState changes.

[6/7]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>We just launched on Product Hunt.

If you've ever wondered whether your morning coffee, your supplement stack, or your diet is actually helping your brain — PrimeState will tell you.

Your brain has patterns. We find them.

[7/7]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tweet 3 (2:00 PM PT — afternoon push):</strong></p>
<pre><code>The response to PrimeState on @ProductHunt today has been incredible.

Best comment so far: &quot;[quote an interesting PH comment]&quot;

Still live — check it out if you haven't → [link]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tweet 4 (6:00 PM PT — evening):</strong></p>
<pre><code>24 hours ago PrimeState didn't exist publicly.

Now [X] people have upvoted it on Product Hunt and [X] have already downloaded it.

The &quot;aha moment&quot; that keeps coming up: people didn't realize food effects could be DELAYED by 48-72 hours.

Your brain fog has a source. Most people just never trace it back far enough.

<h3>Reddit — Strategic Posts (Feb 6-7)</h3>
<p><strong>⚠️ Account u/clarity_hacker is in warmup until Feb 8. NO direct promotion. These are value-first posts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>r/Nootropics — Post (Feb 6, afternoon):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Title: &quot;Has anyone tried systematically tracking if their stack actually works?&quot;

Body:
Genuine question. I've been spending about $200/month on various nootropics and realized I have zero objective evidence that any of it is doing anything.

I started tracking my cognitive performance daily (focus, energy, clarity ratings) alongside everything I take. 60 days in, some interesting findings:

- One supplement I was convinced was helping showed zero correlation with my scores
- A food I eat regularly (corn-based products) seems to tank my focus — but not until 2-3 DAYS later
- Dark chocolate consistently correlates with better focus scores the following day

The delayed effect thing was the real eye-opener. We think about food effects as immediate, but a lot of the cognitive impact seems to happen 24-72 hours later.

Anyone else tracking this kind of thing? Curious what methods people use. I've been using an app called PrimeState that does correlation analysis but I'm interested in how others approach it.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>r/Biohackers — Post (Feb 7):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Title: &quot;Tracked food→cognition correlations for 60 days. 3 findings nobody talks about.&quot;

Body:
I've been logging everything I eat and measuring cognitive performance daily. Using AI-powered correlation analysis to find patterns. Here's what surprised me:

**1. Delayed effects are the real story.**
Everyone talks about how food affects you immediately. The reality? Some of the strongest correlations I found have a 48-72 hour delay. The brain fog I blamed on &quot;bad sleep&quot; was actually linked to specific meals from 2-3 days earlier. Once I stopped eating those foods, the random fog episodes disappeared.

**2. Supplements I was &quot;sure&quot; were working showed zero signal.**
I was spending $80/month on two supplements I would have sworn helped my focus. When I looked at the actual data — my cognitive scores on days I took them vs. days I didn't — no meaningful difference. That's $960/year on placebos.

**3. The strongest cognitive enhancer in my data wasn't a supplement.**
It was meal timing. Specifically, eating a smaller lunch correlated with significantly better afternoon focus. Simple, free, and I never would have tested it without tracking.

The takeaway: your subjective sense of &quot;this works&quot; is unreliable. The data tells a different story. If you're spending money on a stack, you owe it to yourself to actually measure the results.

Tool I used: PrimeState (does the correlation analysis automatically, including delayed effects). But honestly, even a spreadsheet would work if you're disciplined enough. The key is actually measuring, not guessing.

<h3>Bluesky — @clarityhacker.bsky.social</h3>
<p><strong>Post 1 (launch morning):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Your supplement stack is a $60B blind experiment.

We just launched PrimeState on Product Hunt — it finds what actually affects YOUR cognition using YOUR data. Not databases. Not averages. Your patterns.

The kicker: it catches effects that don't show up for 48-72 hours. That random brain fog? Might not be random.

→ [link]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Post 2 (afternoon, standalone thought):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hot take: most people spending $200+/month on supplements have never once measured whether any of it works.

Not &quot;I feel better.&quot; Measured. With data. Over time.

That's like A/B testing in production with no analytics. You'd never ship code that way. Why run your body that way?

<pre><code>Title: Show HN: PrimeState – AI finds what foods and supplements affect your cognition

Body:
I built PrimeState because I was spending $200/month on supplements with no evidence any of them worked.

The core idea: log what you eat, rate your cognitive performance, and let AI find the correlations — including delayed effects that show up 48-72 hours later.

Technical highlights:
- Correlation engine analyzes food/supplement intake against cognitive ratings
- Detects delayed effects (24-72h) using time-shifted cross-correlation
- AI v2 engine identifies patterns across multiple variables
- All analysis runs on YOUR personal data — no population-level assumptions

The most interesting finding from my own use: corn-based products consistently correlate with reduced cognitive performance, but with a ~72 hour delay. I never would have caught that without systematic tracking.

The broader thesis: the supplement industry is a $60B experiment with no control group. Individual responses to food and supplements vary enormously from population averages. The only way to know what works for YOU is to measure it yourself.

Would love technical feedback on the approach. What would make this more rigorous? What am I missing?

<p><strong>Post (Feb 6, morning):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Title: &quot;Just launched PrimeState on Product Hunt — an AI app that finds what foods/supplements affect your cognition&quot;

Body:
Hey IH 👋

Just launched PrimeState on PH today. It's a cognitive performance tracker that uses AI to find correlations between what you eat and how your brain performs.

The insight that started it: I found out that specific foods were affecting my focus for up to 3 days without me realizing it. No health app tracks delayed effects like that — so I built one that does.

Key differentiator: 48-72 hour delayed correlation detection. Most health apps only look at same-day effects. PrimeState's AI engine looks at multi-day patterns that you'd never catch manually.

Would love support on PH if it resonates → [link]

Happy to answer any questions about the build, the AI engine, or the approach. 🧠

<pre><code>The supplement industry generates $60 billion a year.

How much of that is people paying for products that don't work for them?

Not products that don't work period — products that don't work for THAT PERSON.

Individual responses to food and supplements vary enormously. What improves cognitive performance for one person may do nothing for another.

The problem: until now, there was no easy way to measure your own response.

Today we launched PrimeState on Product Hunt. It tracks the connection between what you consume and how your brain performs — including delayed effects that most people never trace back to their diet.

Your body is running experiments every day. PrimeState reads the results.

<h2>THE PRINCIPLES (Read Before Every Post)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Every word earns its place.</strong> No filler. No "excited to announce." No "we're thrilled." Say something real or say nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead with the problem, not the product.</strong> "$200/month on supplements with no evidence" hits harder than "we built an AI-powered cognitive tracker."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be specific.</strong> "Corn tanks my focus for 72 hours" is memorable. "Food affects cognition" is forgettable. Specifics create credibility and curiosity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push boundaries.</strong> The supplement industry is a $60B blind experiment. Say it. The "Placebo Detector" framing isn't just positioning — it's the truth. Lean into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal data &gt; generic claims.</strong> "MY data showed..." is always more compelling than "studies suggest..." because it's inarguable. It happened. To me. Here's the screenshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invite the fight.</strong> "Most people taking supplements have never measured if they work." Some people will disagree. Good. Disagreement is engagement. Engagement is visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Never sound like marketing.</strong> If a sentence could appear in a press release, delete it. Talk like a person who built something because they needed it.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Pre-flight check: Feb 5, 11 PM PT. Everything loaded. Launch at midnight.</em></p></body></html>
